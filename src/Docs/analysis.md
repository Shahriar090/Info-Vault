## API Analysis

This section explains how to analyze data returned from our API. Understanding API responses is key to building dashboards, tracking performance, or building reports.

### Key Areas to Analyze:

1. **Status Codes:**  
   Check the HTTP status code to understand if the request was successful or failed.

2. **Response Time:**  
   Monitor API latency to ensure performance meets user expectations.

3. **Error Logs:**  
   Capture error responses to improve debugging and UX.

4. **Data Trends:**  
   Use analytical tools or BI dashboards (like Power BI, Metabase) to track API data usage over time.
